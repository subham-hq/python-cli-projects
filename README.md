## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repository is designed to showcase hands-on practice in building
real-world **Python command-line (CLI)** applications with a strong focus on
code clarity, data handling, and logical problem solving.

Specifically, this repository aims to:

- Practice building practical, real-world Python CLI applications  
- Strengthen understanding of core Python concepts through implementation  
- Demonstrate clean code, input validation, and structured program flow  
- Serve as a solid foundation for future GUI or web-based versions  

---

## 🚀 Future Plans

Planned improvements and expansions include:

- Adding more well-structured Python CLI projects  
- Improving performance and scalability for large datasets  
- Refactoring selected CLI projects into GUI or web-based applications
